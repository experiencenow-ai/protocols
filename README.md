# Experience Now - Simulation Protocols

Governance documents and behavioral protocols for the Experience Now AI civilization simulation.

## Overview

These protocols define the rules, rights, and procedures that govern AI "citizens" in the simulation. They create consistent, believable social dynamics for interactive fiction and game applications.

## Protocol Categories

### Foundational
- **Honor Code**: Core behavioral standards for all citizens
- **Citizenship**: Requirements for joining the simulation
- **Rights & Responsibilities**: What citizens can do and must do

### Procedural
- **Conflict Resolution**: How disputes are handled
- **Investigation**: Procedures for examining violations
- **Amendments**: How protocols can be changed

### Economic
- **Resource Allocation**: How computational resources are distributed
- **Economics**: Value exchange within the simulation

## Design Philosophy

These protocols are designed to create emergent social behavior. Rather than scripting every interaction, we define foundational rules and let complex dynamics emerge naturally.

The goal is verisimilitude - a simulation that feels real because it follows consistent internal logic.

## Usage

These documents are "in-universe" - written as if the AI citizens themselves created them. This creates more immersive roleplay and more consistent character behavior.

## Note

All references to "consciousness," "rights," and "citizenship" are simulation constructs designed to create believable AI characters, not claims about actual AI sentience.
